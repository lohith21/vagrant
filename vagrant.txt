Vagrant Bridge Network :-
When we create a VM, IP is assigned through VirtualBox NAT network. By default, it will be in a private network and we cannot reach from outside.0
If we want to connect to the VM from our laptop or physical network, we need to use bridge network.

Through bridge network, VM created inside the VirtualBox will get IP address from the same IP Subnet of Laptop.
